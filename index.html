It codes for the prion protein (PrP), which plays roles in cell signaling, synaptic function, and neuronal survival. The PRNP gene is notably associated with prion diseases, a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Mutations or alterations in the PRNP gene can lead to abnormal folding of PrP, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuronal damage. </p> <p>AA in rs1799990, higher (typical) odds of Prion disease.</p><p>	Prion protein Codon 200 (E) - Non pathogenic variant (Good)</p><p>GG in rs74315403, 	PrP codon 178 (D) - non pathogenic variant (good)</p><p>PrP codon P105 - Non-pathogenic form (Good)</p><p>PrP Codon 171 Asn - Non-pathogenic variant (Good)</p> <h2> SLC6A4 Gene Panel </h2> <p> The SLC6A4 gene, also known as the serotonin transporter gene, plays a critical role in neurotransmission by encoding the serotonin transporter protein. This protein is responsible for the reuptake of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. The SLC6A4 gene is essential for maintaining serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft, influencing mood stability and emotional responses. Variations in this gene have been linked to psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). </p> <p>  </p><p>CC in rs1042173, less extreme alcoholism</p><p>CC in rs140701, Normal (lower) risk for anxiety disorders</p><p> </p><p>AA in rs3813034, lower risk of behavioral disorder</p> <h2>FGFR3 Gene Panel </h2> <p> The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3.

Individuals with G6PD deficiency have red blood cells that are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which can result from various factors such as certain medications (e.g., antimalarial drugs, sulfonamides), certain foods (e.g., fava beans), infections, and exposure to certain chemicals or toxins.When red blood cells lacking sufficient G6PD are exposed to oxidative stress, they can undergo hemolysis, or the premature destruction of red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, paleness, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and in severe cases, may result in life-threatening complications. </p><p> healthy, typical genotype in S218F</p><p> no G6PD deficiency, no risk variants in V98M</p><p> TT in rs1050829, lower predisposition to anaemia.</p> <h3> SLC2A1 gene panel </h3> <p> The SLC2A1 gene, also known as the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) gene, encodes a protein called glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).

Mutations or alterations in the SLC2A1 gene can lead to GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired glucose transport into the brain.

<h2> HLA Gene Panel </h2> 
 <button onclick="showHLA()">Check HLA Genotypes</button>  <p> The HLA genes are located on chromosome 6 in humans and encode proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). These proteins play a vital role in immune responses by presenting antigens to immune cells, specifically T cells. There are two main classes of HLA proteins: class I and class II. </p>
<p> The HLA system plays a critical role in several medical contexts, including organ transplantation, where matching HLA types between donor and recipient is crucial to minimize the risk of rejection. Additionally, HLA genes are associated with susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and drug hypersensitivity reactions, making them important targets for medical research and personalized medicine. </p>
<p>Here is a list of conditions affected by, and predicted by this Panel: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis (MS), Sjögren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) – Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, vitiligo, myasthenia gravis, primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis <br> Susceptibility or severity of certain viral infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B and C), some bacterial infections (e.g., leprosy, tuberculosis) <br> Food allergies (e.g., peanut allergy, milk allergy), Allergic rhinitis (hay fever), Atopic dermatitis (eczema), Asthma <br> Allograft rejection, Preeclampsia, and Certain neurological disorders (e.g., narcolepsy)</p>

<h2> Syncope Panel </h2> 
<p> A syncope, commonly known as fainting, is a temporary loss of consciousness and muscle tone caused by a brief reduction in blood flow to the brain. This sudden and temporary loss of consciousness typically results from a drop in blood pressure, leading to a momentary interruption of oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain. Syncope episodes are often brief, lasting only a few seconds to a couple of minutes, and individuals usually recover spontaneously once blood flow is restored. Various factors, such as dehydration, low blood sugar, or sudden changes in body position, can contribute to the occurrence of syncope. </p>

<aside> <p>Blood types, classified by the presence or absence of certain antigens, play a critical role in blood transfusions and medical treatments. There are four main blood types: A, B, AB, and O, each with positive or negative Rh factors. Compatibility for blood transfusions relies on matching donor and recipient blood types to prevent adverse reactions. For instance, type O negative blood is considered the universal donor because it lacks A and B antigens and the Rh factor, making it safe for transfusion to individuals of any blood type. Conversely, AB positive blood is the universal recipient, as it contains no antibodies against A, B, or Rh antigens, allowing it to receive blood from any type without causing a reaction. Additionally, blood types may respond differently to environmental factors and diseases. For instance, individuals with type O blood might have a lower risk of certain diseases like heart disease but may be more susceptible to severe forms of malaria due to the presence of specific antigens on red blood cells. </p> </aside>
